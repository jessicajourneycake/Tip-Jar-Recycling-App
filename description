As stated in the KPMG article, "The Plastic Recycling Opportunity," the demand for recycled plastics is increasing. This is evidenced by companies 
like Coca Cola, Proctor & Gamble, and Unilever making quota commitments to use recycled plastics in their products by 2025. Recycled plastics will
increasingly replace virgin plastic production but can only do so if the supply of recycled plastics can meet the demand. In order to meet the demand,
better pre-sorting of plastics is required to increase the recycling yield and quality. Tip Jar brings the pre-sorting to the home of the everyday 
consumer. Consumer goods companies can opt in to pay consumers tips for them to pre-sort their recyclables and reusables into color-coded "Golden Bins" 
at home. 

Tip Jar is composed of 2 applications in one. The first application is for the everyday consumer. After returning from the grocery store or coffee shop, 
the consumer scans the Tip Jar QR code at the bottom of the receipt or on the reusable item. The Tip Jar QR code contains the barcode(s) or ID(s) from the 
receipt or item and the Tip Jar app runs a query against the Tip Jar Registry to identify which products are registered with Tip Jar. Tip Jar then displays 
the registered products as "in use" for the consumer to monitor.  Once the consumer is finished with the product, they then scan the barcode on the empty 
container. Tip Jar outputs recycling instructions (Ex. Empty and replace cap) as well as instructs the user to place the product into the according 
color-coded Golden Bin. 

Once the user's Golden Bin is full, the user can search for Golden Bin drop-off locations within the app near them. This is where the second application 
comes into play - the Tip Jar Golden Bin Administrator application. A Golden Bin Administrator (typically a grocery store, restaurant, or coffee shop that 
is accessible to consumers) selects which of the colored Golden Bins they want to host on site. All that is required of the Administrator to setup one 
Golden Bin is a large recycling bin as well as one iPad. The Administrator logs in to the Tip Jar iPad application and selects the Golden Bin color they 
want to display on the iPad for the consumers. For example, if the Administrator selects "Green", consumers can only drop off their Green Golden Bin products. 
After the color selection, a Green Golden Bin QR code scanner screen is displayed for consumers to scan their Green Golden Bin QR code, discard their Green 
Golden Bin products and collect their tips. The Tip Jar Golden Bin Administrator application also includes a one-item verification step which requires 
consumers to scan one item's barcode from their Green Golden Bin that they are collecting tips for. The Golden Bin Administrator applications then places tips 
into the consumers Tip Jar that the consumer can then redeem as cash or transfer to their bank account.
